# Inner class Singleton

Singleton - is a generative design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to it.

Inner class allows us to implement a lazy implementation thanks to the peculiarities of Java. The inner class are loaded only when we access them for the first time. And it is thread-safe.
